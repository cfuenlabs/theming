The official [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) palette of the CFuen Labs dark theme. Used to generate the base version of every CFL color scheme through the [Base24 Python Builder](https://github.com/Base24/base24-builder-python/tree/master), which is later polished and tweaked to fit CFL's aesthetic better. The Base16 standard was used for ease of production and in an effort to support the [Tinted Theming Project](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home#tinted-theming-all-your-themes-everywhere-)
