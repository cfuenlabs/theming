# Licensing

Anything inside the theme-data folder is licensed under the MIT license, while everything inside the tools folder is licensed under the GPL-3. While the theme data files don't enforce a license and are only concerned with the color schemes being credited when used in other software, the internal tools used by CFuen Labs use a copyleft license to ensure that they contribute to FLOSS software and the Libre Software movement.
